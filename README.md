This repository contains some notes about a problem involving coverings of coatoms in partition lattices, which we prove is NP-complete.

**Title:** [Filter membership of coatoms in a partition lattice is NP-complete] (https://github.com/TypeFunc/lat-nae-3sat/raw/master/article/lat-nae-3sat.pdf)

**Abstract:**
We show that [3-SAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3sat)
reduces to the problem of deciding whether all coatoms in a certain partition
lattice are contained in the union of a collection of certain principal filters
of the lattice, so the latter problem is NP-complete.
We conclude with a discussion of the tractability of
such filter membership problems.
